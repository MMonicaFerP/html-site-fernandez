Despite the sustainability statements and green movements almost all fashion brands have claimed to join recently, fast fashion brands sales report positions them at the top of the clothing business. Shein, a Chinese fashion company, has an estimated of $10 billion in revenue which make them at the top of sales in the industry despite its many controversies due to its notorious low prices and business practices. It’s hard to think of a closet in the U.S.A that doesn’t carry a garment that could be considered textile waste - made of synthetic and plastic-based fabrics that could take 200+ years for the materials to decompose in a landfill-. 
The damage was purchased already. The goal now is to not extend the consequences with suggested practices by different environmental organizations that would keep fabrics in good shape and away from our oceans.

	<div> A microfiber filter is one of the recent aid to keep microplastic from drained water after washing clothes. It is known that up to 700,000 plastic fibres could be released per wash. The New York Times reported than “18 to 24 shopping bags full of small plastic fragments for every foot of coastline on every continent except Antarctica”. </div>

	  <div>Hanging clothes is a promoted practice that saves money while keeping clothes in better shape for longer. According to The Natural Resources Defense Council, the use of dryers cost Americans $9 billion each year in energy costs and represents a technology that hasn’t been improved significantly since the 1970s. This would place dryers among the least efficient of all household appliances.</div>

 <div>With repair tutorials on different platforms, fixing or upgrading garments has become more accessible and a budget-friendly activity that keeps piles of clothes out of landfills. The EPA reports that Americans generate 16 million tons of textile waste a year, equaling just over six percent of total municipal waste (for context, plastics make up 13 percent of our waste stream).</div>

  <div>Thrif stores are promoted businesses that can reduce the purchases of new clothes and the negative environmental and human rights impact within clothing production. This industry has been reported by its links with global crimes such as precarious labor conditions, child labor,and slavery. Major garment manufacturing countries including Myanmar, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Vietnam are considered an "extreme risk" for modern slavery.</div>
